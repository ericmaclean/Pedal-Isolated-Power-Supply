# Pedal-Isolated-Power-Supply

This a project folder for a 9 channel isolated power supply. The design is based around the WPDL transformer that steps down 120VAC to 9VAC with 9 separate secondary windings. The isolated secondary windings ensure there are no ground loops contributing to common mode noise. I have a feeling that most cheap power supplies that advertise to be isolated are not truly isolated. The AC waveform is rectified and and then filtered and passed to linear regulator which holds the DC output at 9V. 

## Features: 

- True isolation
- Full bridge rectification
- MOV and TVS surge protection
- EMI filtering
